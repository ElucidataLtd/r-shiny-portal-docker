# r-shiny-portal-docker
## monolith branch

The `monolith` branch holds the Dockerfile used briefly for the MI Portal (v2.6.0 and v2.6.1) based on debian:buster,
but was retired because using ubuntu as a base image was found to reduce the number of reported security issues significantly.

The branch is retained for reference.
